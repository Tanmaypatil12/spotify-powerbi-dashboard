# Spotify Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard analyzes Spotify Top 50 data to understand song and artist performance across multiple dimensions.  
It supports analysis for music analysts, playlist teams, and marketing stakeholders by providing clear KPIs, trends, and drill-down views.

## Business Context
The Spotify Top 50 dataset is available as ranked lists, which makes it difficult to:
- Monitor overall performance metrics
